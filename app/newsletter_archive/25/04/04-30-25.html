            <li><strong>What is your favorite kanji?</strong><br><br>
                I like this question :)<br>
                My favorite kanji is 映. It shows up in verbs like 映る (to be reflected) and 映す (to reflect). I like it because my favorite word in any language is “reflection” (반영; 反映)—not in the writing-assignment way, but more in a figurative and visual sense, like a mirror image (像). I like the visual image of 映, but I also think it’s an interesting and powerful idea how our actions reflect back to ourselves and others and this awareness helps us be better people.<br><br>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>What’s a memorable quote or story you heard at the Conversation Hour?</strong>
                <br><br>
                It’s not from one particular session, but whenever someone says that Conversation Hour is relaxing, fun, or a nice break in their busy day, it really sticks with me (though I hope they’re not overworking themselves the rest of the time!). This means a lot because I truly hope these hours feel like a pressure-free space to just talk and connect and I also really enjoyed them myself. I’m so thankful for everyone and your time, since your presence genuinely makes those moments shine! 😊<br><br>
                
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>What Japanese media (whether it’s a movie, song, book, etc.) have you enjoyed/would recommend?</strong>
                <br><br>
                If you enjoy songs with good lyrics, I’d recommend artists like Tomonari Sora, Kamiyama Yoh, and YOASOBI! Their lyrics often feel like soliloquy or lines from a play, so it’s fun making sense of the narrator’s story & emotions.<br>
                Some of my favorite songs are: “Closet” - Kamiyama Yoh, “鬼ノ宴 (Demons Banquet)” - Tomonari Sora, and “勇者 (The Brave)” - Yoasobi.<br><br>
                
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Top 3 classes you took at Cornell?</strong><br><br>
                
                - PSYCH 4331 Event Cognition: How Minds, Brains and Bodies Experience Events<br>
                - INFO 3152&4152 Intro & Advanced Game Design<br>
                - ASIAN 5505 Methodology of Asian Language Learning & Teaching<br>
                There’s no ranking among them and I like them for different reasons but they are all connected. I haven’t thought about it before, but listing these out makes me realize that I like classes that are about applying knowledge.<br><br>
                
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning Japanese?</strong><br><br>
                Probably reading <= writing kanji. I speak Korean so I am familiar with Chinese characters, but most of the time they are not written out in Korean as frequently as in Japanese. Also, they are often used for different occasions (e.g., words, context), so I had to familiarize myself with the kanji’s usage. Since there are similar words in Korean & Japanese–often a combination of the same characters but pronounced differently–I have a lot of moments where I am speaking in Japanese and I try to directly translate something from Korean and think, “Wait… that’s not right.” If I am not careful, I end up responding like I would in Korean, so I try to stay mindful of that. (If I ever made a slip during conversation hours, I’m sorry! But I wasn’t too worried since I know that we have great role models like Cougar to learn from😊! ) Besides this, respectful language feels difficult! I have an East Asian background to tell me when to use it, but choosing the right Japanese expressions is a challenge.<br><br>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>What advice do you have for someone learning Japanese?</strong><br><br>
                I’d say–make it fun😆! (Honestly, I think this applies to learning any language.)<br>
                Find something you genuinely enjoy doing in Japanese, whether it’s watching a movie, listening to music, or joining something like conversation hour (haha). Subtitles definitely help, and I would recommend thinking open-mindedly because these opportunities can be anywhere–for instance, I enjoyed watching e-sports competitions with Japanese commentary. It doesn’t have to be media either. You might just enjoy a certain aspect of the language. I personally like four-character idioms (四字熟語) so I used to write them down whenever I came across them.<br>
                I believe formal studying is also needed at some point, but I also think that considering it as a way to better apply the knowledge to the sources you love might feel less overwhelming😊.<br><br>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>What do you plan on doing after graduation?</strong><br><br>
                
                I’ll be starting a master’s program in psychology. Hopefully I can enjoy the new environment! But before that, I’m heading back home this summer. I don’t have specific plans yet, but I might do some part-time work, prepare for grad school, catch up with my high school friends, and enjoy lots of home-cooked meals!<br>
                But honestly speaking, I still can't believe that I am graduating… time flies for sure……!!! I am sure that I will miss all the good old faces from the conversation hours… waaaa😂😂 Thank you all, special thanks to Tami & Cougar, and I wish you all a wonderful summer!
